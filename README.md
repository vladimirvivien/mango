# mango
Playground for an automated build tool in Go.

### Pre-requisites
 * Install Go - https://golang.org/doc/install
 * `$> go get github.com/vladimirvivien/mango`

### Using Mango
 1. Create a .build directory in your Go project
 1. Create `.build/main.go `
 1. Add `mango tasks` in your main file
 1. Build your project with `go run .build/*`

## Components
Mango uses several components that you should understand before you can use it effectively.

### The Builder
As you would imagine, this is a component responsible for `building stuff`.  The builder knows how to configure and launch its build system as implemented by the builder provider.  Today, mango provides one builder, the `Go Builder`, that can compile and test Go source code.  This builder uses the awesome GB tool (https://getgb.io/) from Dave Cheney.

### Tasks
The mango `task` is how you, the person creating an automated build script, interacts with mango.  A task is basically a Go function that implements simple or complex steps that are part of the build exeuction flow.     

### The Build Files
The mango `build` files is collection of one or more Go source files.  Each file, in turn, is made up of a mix of mango tasks and other Go constructs that specify how the build flow should work.  The entry point for a build should be defined in a Go file called `main.go` with a function `func main()` defined.

### The .mango Directory
All mango build files should be stored (as a convention) in a `.mango` directory at the root level of your Go project.  The build step can then be launched using `go run .mango`.

## Using Mango
The first step is to create a directory in your Go project called `.mango`.  Next, create `.mango/main.go` with the following content.
```
package main

import "github.com/vladimirvivien/mango

func task2(){

}

mango.Builder = mango.GoBuilder

project := mango.NewProject("project")

mango.AddTask(func(ctx context){...})
mango.AddParallelTasks(func2, func3)

func main() {

}
```
